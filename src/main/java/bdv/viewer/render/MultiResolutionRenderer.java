/**
 * A renderer that uses a coarse-to-fine rendering scheme. First, a small target
 * image at a fraction of the canvas resolution is rendered. Then, increasingly
 * larger images are rendered, until the full canvas resolution is reached.
 * <p>
 * When drawing the low-resolution target images to the screen, they will be
 * scaled up by Java2D (or JavaFX, etc) to the full canvas size, which is
 * relatively fast. Rendering the small, low-resolution images is usually very
 * fast, such that the display is very interactive while the user changes the
 * viewing transformation for example. When the transformation remains fixed for
 * a longer period, higher-resolution details are filled in successively.
 * <p>
 * The renderer allocates a {@code RenderResult} for each of a predefined set of
 * <em>screen scales</em> (a screen scale of 1 means that 1 pixel in the screen
 * image is displayed as 1 pixel on the canvas, a screen scale of 0.5 means 1
 * pixel in the screen image is displayed as 2 pixel on the canvas, etc.)
 * <p>
 * At any time, one of these screen scales is selected as the <em>highest screen
 * scale</em>. Rendering starts with this highest screen scale and then proceeds
 * to lower screen scales (higher resolution images). Unless the highest screen
 * scale is currently rendering, {@link #requestRepaint() repaint request} will
 * cancel rendering, such that display remains interactive.
 * <p>
 * The renderer tries to maintain a per-frame rendering time close to
 * {@code targetRenderNanos} nanoseconds. The current highest screen scale is
 * chosen to match this time based on per-output-pixel time measured in previous
 * frames.
 * <p>
 * The renderer uses multiple threads (if desired).
 * <p>
 * The renderer supports rendering of {@link Volatile} sources. In each
 * rendering pass, all currently valid data for the best fitting mipmap level
 * and all coarser levels is rendered to a temporary image for each visible
 * source. Then the temporary images are combined to the final image for
 * display. The number of passes required until all data is valid might differ
 * between visible sources.
 * <p>
 * Rendering timing is tied to a {@link CacheControl} control for IO budgeting,
 * etc.
